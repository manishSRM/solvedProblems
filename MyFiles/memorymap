		MEMORY MAP
when we make a code then we get memory for use is mainly three parts.
1. data-segment:
2. stack:
3. code-segment:

1. Data-segment:- It has three parts:
	a. Data: This momory is mainly used by the initialized Global variables, static variables.
		example:
			int global = 100;  //initialized global variable 
			int main() {}
			so, the memory used by variable global it is in Data section.
    
	b. BSS: This part of the memory used by the uninitialized global variables, static variables.
		example:
			int global; 
			int main() {}    //uninitialized global variable
			the memory used by variable global it is in BSS section.

	c. Heap:This part of the memory used by the varibles which are dynamically generated or variable which are used at the run time.
		example:
			int *num = new int;
			so, here the memory used by num it is in the stack section and a memory of 4 byte is in the heap section from
			new int statement.  
2. Stack: This momory is mainly used by the local variables in the function.
	example:
		void swap (int a, int b) {
				//body of fuction
				}
		int main() {
			int num1, num2;
			}
		so, here their are two function one is main function and  second is swap function and four variables 2 are in different 		diffrent function but the memory used by all variable is in the stack section. 	 
3. code-segment: This momory is used by the program code written by us.
